      This multi-day historic and cultural activity is held each year in the shade of the monumental trees of the Scera Park in Orem.  Attracting in excess of 40,000 visitors annually, the event is the largest of its kind west of the Mississippi River with more than 100 artisans, educators, and re-enactors.  These volunteers establish a Colonial American village and demonstrate everyday life from various periods of era that preceded the American Revolution.  The Blacksmith, the cooper, the potter, the baker, and the coffin maker are just a few of the period shops that come to life with continuous demonstrations of eighteenth century craftsmanship. In addition storytellers and re-enactors portray famous and lesser known Americans who shaped the events that led to forming of a new nation in the new world.  Cannons and a 1700's printing press are a couple of the main attractions to the event which helps students, young and old, feel a deep appreciation for history, culture, values and skills of our founding generation.

      Yes we have a class in Historic Bread Making:  In this class, students learn the basics of making naturally-leavened bread.  We begin with how to culture a start from scratch and proceed to recipes and techniques for making incredibly delicious with the same few ingredients that our colonial forefathers used: wheat, water and salt.  We learn what adaptation need to be made to successfully bake this lean bread in home ovens  Follow our student's progress at http://historicbread.colonialheritage.org
